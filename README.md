# A model of semantic completion in generative episodic memory
## About this repo:

This repo contains the code for the following paper: 
[Fayyaz, Zahra, et al. "A model of semantic completion in generative episodic memory." arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.13537 (2021).](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13537)

Some of the pretrained model weights are also given to faciliate the results replication. By importing the weights it should be easy to replicate the paper results on a PC.

The notebooks are commented and should be easy to follow.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions / comments. Thank you very much in advance!

## Getting started:
This branch uses standalone Keras with a Tensorflow 1.14 backend.

To get started, first install the required libraries inside a virtual environment:

# Generative-episodic-memory
## About this repo:

This repo contains the code for the following paper: 
Fayyaz, Zahra, et al. "A model of semantic completion in generative episodic memory." arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.13537 (2021).

Some of the pretrained model weights are also given to faciliate the results replication. By importing the weights it should be easy to replicate the paper results on a PC.
The notebooks are commented and should be easy to follow.
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions / comments. Thank you very much in advance!
